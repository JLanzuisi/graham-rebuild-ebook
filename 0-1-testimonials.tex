\noindent \emph{Rebuild} delivers exactly what it says on the cover: a toolkit for you to build a better world. It contains the most useful business and personal toolkit I’ve seen, and has radically transformed my worldview. Organisations, jobs and practically everything\textemdash we're trying to reinvent them, but are we succeeding? This book makes reinvention work; it's written as part guidebook, part theoretical overview with scientific underpinnings, and a completely relatable narrative with fascinating anecdotes. It is for anyone who wants to build solutions to our global challenges.

\noindent The \emph{Adaptive Way} chapter in \emph{Rebuild} made me realise that seeking validation from others to build my business (Solve Earth) is a self-defeating trap, because no single person has the capability to understand fully what I, or any other person, is capable of. I can continue on my journey into the unknown with advice and guidance from others, but ultimately, I must rely on my own decision making and self-validation. This is an incredibly liberating and empowering insight that gives me the courage to take on the biggest challenges in sustainability and building a better future society.

\noindent We know now that organisations who embody natural and evolutionary design principles, not only thrive but build critical resilience and sustainability. 
This architecture also needs to be re-evolved and re-generated to meet the needs of today's global market dynamics and for our collective humanity so you hold in your hands a book that gives you a road map to a journey how this is best achieved and executed.

\noindent \emph{Rebuild} presents an integrated vision\textemdash one that transcends polarities and makes the old divisions obsolete. This is one of many qualities shared by great visions. It is also a systemic vision that not only aims to transform our consciousness, but also the systems that forcefully perpetuate and enforce the old consciousness. It is a pragmatic vision based on available experiments, examples, and research, and doesn't require rebuilding society from scratch. And it is a radical vision, that doesn't focus on putting patches on the problem, but emerges from asking powerful ambitious questions like \emph{how can we build an economy that harnesses all of the human capacities, like cooperation, compassion, and self-interest, to provision for all while regenerating all our capitals: financial, social, and  natural?}
