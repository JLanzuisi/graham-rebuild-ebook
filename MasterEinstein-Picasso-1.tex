\partdescription{Art and Physics}{In which we introduce the foundations of this book: your experienced reality is a consequence of how you look at the world, i.e., the lenses you look through. Cubism, relativity and quantum mechanics give us new lenses on business and economics.}

\input{./1-emergence-theme-0.5}
\input{./2-Emergence-Einstein-Picasso-0.5}


\partdescription{Economy}{These chapters give an overview of how the economy as it is has emerged, and propose ways of reinventing the economy: the Economy of the Free. Drawing on apartheid as a metaphor you'll see why our current structuring of companies cannot deliver the economy our society needs, how the FairShares Commons addresses that issue, and how a new approach to economics can address the issues of neoclassical economics. }

\partdescription{You}{We humans are the alpha and omega of society, its economy, and our organisations. These chapters introduce you to how your meaning-making stories create your self-identity, and are the lens you use to look at everything through; how your fluidity in the 28 thought forms of transformational thinking determine your capacity to grasp a nebulous, VUCA world; and what you can do to harness tension in your life to grow.}
